The external JSON can be accessed via a Github link: "https://han20100128.github.io/wdos2-a3/coffeeShop.json"
However, the same JSON file is also included in this package, which can be accessed and used in the website through local host.
Another option is to use directly the constant JSON coffeeShop in the script, which is currently made as a comment.
